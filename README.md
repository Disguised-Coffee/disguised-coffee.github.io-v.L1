# disguised-coffee.github.io-v.L1


A website to introduce and describe myself to Github and other users. 
The current goal of this website was to create a responsive website to describe myself while extending my HTML and CSS knowledge as well as exploring the usage of Javascript in websites.

## Known bugs
- the h3 tag of the About Me article is blocked after clicking the About Me button. I believe this is due to the placement of the '#aboutMe' id?
